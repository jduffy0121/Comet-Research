# Comet Research
*Done with the Auburn University AMO (Atomic, Molecular, Optical) Physics Research Group*  
Began working in February 2022.  

## Spring 2022
Got introduced to the physics behind the haser/vectorial models.  
Worked on setting up a fully working Linux enviorment for me to code in using Anaconda.  
Created a simple program that used sbpy, matplotlib, astropy, scipy to make sure the enviorment works.  

## Summer 2022
Took as a 4 credit hour research course.  
Created an UI for running calculations for the vectorial model using a repository called pyvectorial created by sjoset.  
This UI used PyQt5 to be created.
